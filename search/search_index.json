Certificates provide a secure, manageable, and standards-based way to authenticate applications. A <code>.pfx</code> certificate may be required because Azure AD expects a certificate in Personal Information Exchange (PFX) format when uploading via the portal or for certain SDKs. The <code>.pfx</code> file contains both the public and private keys, protected by a password, and is suitable for import/export scenarios.</p>"},{"location":"azure-ad-certificate/#steps-to-generate-a-certificate-using-openssl","title":"Steps to Generate a Certificate Using OpenSSL","text":"<ol> <li>Generate a Private Key: <code>sh    openssl genrsa -out my-app-auth.key 2048</code></li> <li>Create a Certificate Signing Request (CSR): <code>sh    openssl req -new -key my-app-auth.key -out my-app-auth.csr</code></li> <li>Generate a Self-Signed Certificate: <code>sh    openssl x509 -req -days 730 -in my-app-auth.csr -signkey my-app-auth.key -out my-app-auth.crt</code></li> <li>Export to PFX (if needed for Azure): <code>sh    openssl pkcs12 -export -out my-app-auth.pfx -inkey my-app-auth.key -in my-app-auth.crt</code> <p>Note: The <code>.pfx</code> format is required if you want to upload the certificate via the Azure Portal or use it with some SDKs/tools.
