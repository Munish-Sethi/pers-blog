## 🎯 **What We'll Configure**

In this part, we'll configure the Proofpoint Essentials side of the integration:
1. **Domain Relay Configuration** - Set up mail routing to Office 365
2. **Security Features** - Enable comprehensive email protection
3. **Email Warning Tags** - Configure user notification system
4. **DKIM Key Management** - Generate and manage authentication keys
5. **User Provisioning and SSO** - Enable user access (overview)

---

## 🔧 **Prerequisites**

Before starting, ensure you have:
- [ ] Proofpoint Essentials administrator access
- [ ] Office 365 connectors from Part 3 configured and tested
- [ ] DNS records from Part 2 implemented
- [ ] Your Office 365 tenant's mail protection endpoint (e.g., yourdomain-com.mail.protection.outlook.com)

---

## 📧 **Domain Relay Configuration**

This is the foundation that tells Proofpoint where to send clean emails after filtering.

### **Step 1: Access Domain Configuration**

1. **Log into Proofpoint Essentials**
   - Navigate to your Proofpoint admin portal
   - Sign in with administrator credentials

2. **Navigate to Domains**
   - Click **Email** in the left navigation
   - Select **Domains**
   - Click **Add Domain** or select existing domain

### **Step 2: Configure Domain Settings**

```
Domain Information:
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Domain Type: Relay                  │
│ Domain Name: yourdomain.com         │
│ Primary Delivery Destination:       │
│ yourdomain-com.mail.protection.     │
│ outlook.com                         │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

#### **Finding Your O365 Mail Protection Endpoint:**
Your endpoint follows this pattern:
- **Format**: `[domain-with-dashes].mail.protection.outlook.com`
- **Example**: For `yourdomain.com` → `yourdomain-com.mail.protection.outlook.com`
- **Verification**: Check your MX record in Office 365 Admin Center

### **Step 3: Verify Domain Configuration**

After saving, ensure:
- [ ] Domain status shows as **Active**
- [ ] Primary delivery destination is correct
- [ ] No error messages in domain configuration
