# Sample Blog Article

Welcome to your first blog post using MkDocs!

## Introduction

This is a sample article to demonstrate how blogging works with MkDocs. You can write your articles in Markdown, and MkDocs will render them beautifully.

## How to Add More Articles

1. Create a new Markdown file for each article (e.g., `my-second-article.md`).
2. Add a reference to the new file in your `mkdocs.yml` under the `nav` section.
3. Rebuild or serve your site to see the new article.

## Example Content

- You can use **bold**, *italic*, and other Markdown features.
- Add images, code blocks, and more.

```python
print("Hello, MkDocs Blog!")
```

## Example: Simple Python Function

Below is a sample Python function. You can use the copy button (provided by the Material theme) to copy the code:

```python
def greet(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")

greet("World")
```

## Example: Data Processing with Pandas

Here is a more advanced example using pandas:

```python
import pandas as pd

data = {'Name': ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie'], 'Age': [25, 30, 35]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
print(df)
```

Happy blogging!

You can add more code blocks like these. The copy button appears automatically if you have `content.code.copy` enabled in your mkdocs.yml (which you do).
