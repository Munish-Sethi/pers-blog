# Cleaning Up Obsolete FSLogix Profiles in Azure

Obsolete FSLogix profile containers can consume significant storage and increase costs in Azure environments. This article explains how to identify and delete outdated profiles using a Bash script, helping you save space and reduce expenses. The approach is multi-step: first, list and analyze profiles, then safely delete those that are no longer needed. This process is ideal for automation and can be run in a container for portability and security.

---

## Why Clean Up Obsolete Profiles?
- **Cost Savings:** Old FSLogix profile containers can accumulate and consume large amounts of Azure Files storage, leading to unnecessary costs.
- **Performance:** Removing unused profiles can improve performance and reduce clutter.
- **Compliance:** Regular cleanup helps maintain a tidy, compliant environment.

## Multi-Step Approach
1. **List and Analyze Profiles:** Identify which profiles are old and candidates for deletion.
2. **Delete Obsolete Profiles:** Remove only those that are confirmed to be outdated.

This article covers the first stepâ€”identifying obsolete profiles. (You can extend the script to perform deletions after review.)

## Example Script: Identify Obsolete FSLogix Profiles

Below is a Bash script that lists FSLogix profile containers in an Azure Files share, checks their last modified date, and logs those that haven't been updated in a specified number of days. All sensitive values are masked for security.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Define the output log files
deleteLogFile="step1-verbose.log"
sizeLogFile="step1-filesize.log"
deleteFile="step1-input4step2.txt"

# Variables (replace with your own values)
resourceGroupName="<your-resource-group>"
storageAccountName="<your-storage-account>"
fileShareName="<your-file-share>"
daysThreshold=30
maxProfiles=500  # Limit the number of profiles to process

# Determine the script directory
scriptDir="$(dirname \"$(realpath \"$0\")\")"
deleteFile="$scriptDir/$deleteFile"
sizeFile="$scriptDir/$sizeLogFile"
deleteLogFile="$scriptDir/$deleteLogFile"

# Delete existing files if they exist
if [ -f "$deleteFile" ]; then
    echo "Deleting existing delete file: $deleteFile"
    rm "$deleteFile"
fi

if [ -f "$deleteLogFile" ]; then
    echo "Deleting existing delete log file: $deleteLogFile"

## Step-by-Step Explanation

1. **Setup and Variable Initialization:**
   - The script sets up log file names and variables for the resource group, storage account, and file share (all masked for security).
   - It determines the script directory and ensures log files are fresh for each run.

2. **Fetch Storage Account Key:**
   - Uses the Azure CLI to retrieve the storage account key for authentication.

3. **Date Calculations:**
   - Gets the current date and calculates the threshold date (e.g., 30 days ago) to identify old profiles.

4. **List Profile Directories:**
   - Uses `az storage file list` to enumerate all profile directories in the file share.

5. **Analyze Each Profile:**
   - For each profile directory, lists files and looks for `.vhdx` files (FSLogix containers).
   - Retrieves file size and last modified date for each `.vhdx` file.
   - If the file hasn't been updated in the threshold period, adds it to the delete candidates list.

6. **Log Results:**
   - Writes a sorted list of profile sizes to a log file for review.
   - Writes a list of outdated profiles to a separate file for potential deletion.

7. **Output:**
   - All output is logged for auditing and review before any deletion is performed.

## Benefits of Running in a Container
- **Isolation:** Keeps dependencies and credentials isolated from your local environment.
- **Portability:** Easily run the script in any environment with Docker or container support.
- **Security:** Credentials and logs are contained within the container.

---

## Next Steps: Deleting Obsolete Profiles
- Review the generated log files to confirm which profiles are safe to delete.
- You can extend this script to delete profiles by using `az storage file delete` for each candidate.
- Always back up or confirm with stakeholders before deleting user data.

---

## Usage Example
This script is typically run as part of a maintenance workflow, either manually or on a schedule. For example, you might:
- Run the script in a container or Azure Cloud Shell.
- Review the output files (`step1-filesize.log` and `step1-input4step2.txt`).
- Use a follow-up script to delete the confirmed obsolete profiles.

**By regularly cleaning up obsolete FSLogix profiles, you can save on Azure storage costs and keep your environment healthy and efficient.**
